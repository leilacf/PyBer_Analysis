# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, working under the guide of the ride sharing app, PyBer, we utilized ride sharing data by city type to create a detailed analysis on how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

## Results
Based off of the analysis, the data showed that were major differences in the use of ride sharing depending on the city type.

As can be seen in the image above, the largest amount of total rides occured in urban cities (1,625), which also had the most drivers (2,405) and highest total fares ($39,854.38). In comparison with the rural cities which had the smallest amount of total rides (125), with (78) drivers and total fares of ($4,327.93). Due to an underwhelming supply of drivers in rural cities and a rising demand, average fares per ride were highest in rural cities ($34.62) when compared to suburban and urban. This same logic can follow the average fare per driver, where rural cities remain with the highest amount at ($55.49).

Additionally, in the graph below we captured the weekly total fare by city type:

As expected, due to larger populations which results in a larger need for transportation, urban cities higher weekly fares. All three city types peaked towards the end of February, but then differed greatly in their weekly fare totals. The primary differences shown in the varying city types and their relationship with the use of PyBer, can clearly be seen in the graph above. 

## Summary
Based on these results, the following are three business reccomendations that address the disparities among the city types:
- In increasing average driver salary, while making the job requirements more detailed, the quality of work from the drivers could increase (creating more of a luxurious/professional ride share experience) while reducing the overall current drivers on the road, as some would have to be filtered out with this method. This would best impact urban cities as this small decrease in supply could lead to higher average fares as the demand for the use of this good from the population, continuusly increases regardless of the wait time, costs, etc.
- In rural cities, it would be best to coordinate with the elected officials of these cities, to create incentives for the population to want to move around more and therefore, use ride sharing apps. For example, public events could be hosted, local restaurants could have special weekly deals, or pop-up shops around the cities could appear creating an interactive environment for more people to move around. If these activities were implemented smoothly, a larger percentage of the population could be incentivized to use PyBer.
- Lastly, in suburban cities, I would reccomend to analyze the population break down first. What percentage of the population in suburban cities have children? How many identify as single couples? what is the age range? In utilizing this information, we can see what types of activities would best cater to the populations needs. Perhaps with the combination of the reccomendations above, individuals in suburban cities can be incentivized to either travel to urban or rural cities depending on the activities found there. In addition to this, Pyber could partner with some of these businesses to create "deals" or "coupons" where if one uses Pyber to get to a certain destination, on arrival, the Pyber screen has a 20% off coupon for them to use at the destination.
